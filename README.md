# Caitlin Stevenson | Team Profile Generator Assignment

## Objectives

In this project, I attempted to create a team profile generator using inquirer to run prompts in the command line and jest to run tests on the functionality. To test the team profile generator the user should clone down the repo and run `npm install` in their command line. The user can then run `node index.js` to launch the prompts from the command line and enter their team profile data.
